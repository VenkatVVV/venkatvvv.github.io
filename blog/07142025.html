                Hey everyone,

                It feels a little raw to be writing this, but if there’s one thing I’ve learned recently, it’s that pretending everything is fine just doesn’t cut it. So, here it goes: at the beginning of May 2025, I was let go from my job. <br>
                <br>
                Ouch. Even typing that still feels a bit… strange. In those first few weeks, honestly, I was a mess. There was a lot of processing, a lot of feeling lost, and a whole lot of just… being. I decided to give myself the time I needed to actually feel what I was feeling, to heal a bit emotionally before even thinking about dusting off the resume. <br>
                <br>
                And now, the job hunt. Ah, the glorious job hunt. We all know the drill, right? Spending hours crafting the perfect cover letter, tailoring your resume for the millionth time, and then sending your hopes and dreams out into the digital void. And the silence! Oh, the deafening silence. You send out hundreds of applications, and often, you hear absolutely nothing back. It’s like you never even existed. Let’s just call it what it is: ghosting. In any other area of life, it’s considered rude, so why is it somehow acceptable professional practice? It’s tiring, disheartening, and frankly, makes you question everything. <br>
                <br>
                Then, if you’re lucky enough to land an interview (or three, or five!), the whole dance begins. Prepping, researching the company inside and out, practicing those dreaded coding challenges, trying to say all the right things, and putting on your “best professional self.” It’s exhausting. It truly drains you, this constant cycle of hope and potential rejection. <br>
                <br>
                There are days, I won’t lie, where the exhaustion is overwhelming. You start to doubt yourself, to wonder if you’ll ever find the right fit. But somewhere, deep down, that little spark of belief flickers. I know I have something to offer. I know I’m capable. And I truly believe that what is meant for me will eventually find its way. <br>
                <br>
                This whole experience, this beautiful mess of uncertainty, has been a harsh but valuable teacher. It’s forcing me to sit with the unknown, to accept that I don’t have all the answers (and that’s okay!). It’s teaching me resilience, and maybe, just maybe, it’s leading me to something even better than I could have imagined. <br>
                <br>
                So, if you’re out there navigating your own patch of uncertainty, whether it’s a job loss, a career change, or just the general feeling of not knowing what’s next, please know you’re not alone. Be kind to yourself. Allow yourself to feel all the feels. And try, just try, to embrace the beautiful mess of not knowing. Because sometimes, the most amazing things happen when we least expect them. <br>
