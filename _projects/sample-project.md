# Sample Data Science Project

This is an example of how to structure a project page on your portfolio website. Below, you'll find sections that you can use to showcase your data science projects effectively.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to analyze and visualize complex datasets using Python. It includes machine learning models, data preprocessing, and interactive visualizations.

## Problem Statement

Describe the problem you were trying to solve or the question you were trying to answer with this project.

## Data

- **Dataset Source**: [Link to dataset]
- **Size**: X GB
- **Features**: List of key features
- **Target Variable**: What you were trying to predict/analyze

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Handling missing values
- Data normalization

### Model Development
- Model selection
- Training process
- Validation approach

### Visualization
- Key visualizations
- Insights discovered

## Results

Include your key findings and results here. You can add:
- Performance metrics
- Visualizations
- Key insights
- Business impact

## Code Example

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load and preprocess data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
X = df.drop('target', axis=1)
y = df['target']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
score = model.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Model accuracy: {score:.2f}")
```

## Future Work
