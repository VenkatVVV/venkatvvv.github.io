<p>As rhetorical as the title of this blog post sounds, I really do want to write a personal update on everything that I’ve been upto over these last few weeks. How I’ve been feeling, what I’ve learned, the places I’ve been and the spaces I’m headed towards. I’ve always kept writing as a secretive outlet for me to organize my thoughts independently, and although I still do feel that way, I want to become more comfortable with sharing my piece of mind into the public domain.</p>

<p>And what better way to do that than jumping off a cliff head first into the cold water and forcing myself to swim.</p>

<p>That is a metaphor ofcourse, but it was actually something I made myself do recently - An exercise I like to call “facing my fears”</p>
